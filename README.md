### Next-generation initiatives advancing open

In this panel, we'll hear from initiatives led by students and early
career academic professionals which are catalyzing progress on Open
Access, Open Education, and Open Data around the world. We'll hear
their inspiring stories, from Canada to Nepal, of sparking
change. We'll also find out where they found support, what challenges
they faced, and their words of advice for participants.

### Abstract

The #BulliedIntoBadScience campaign was initiated after several
attempts to influence publishing practices at the University of
Cambridge and in the UK. However, it seems at times impossible for
academics, early stage and more senior, to change a broken system that
is, sadly, just accepted by most. I'll share some of the background of
the #BulliedIntoBadScience campaign and reflect on early career
researchers' challenges in fighting for a more ethical environment.
