> I have been constantly harassed by superiors to modify data in order
  to provide better agreement with known experimental values in order
  to make the paper look better for publishing at prestigious
  journals.

The Bullied Into Bad Science campaign is an initiative by early career
researchers (ECRs) for early career researchers who aim for a fairer,
more open and ethical research and publication environment.

**135 ECR have signed it** - **71 non-ECRs support it**

## Background

- Elsevier/JISC negociations (mid 2016) - FAIL
- Discussions at the University of Cambridge (end 2016) - mixed results
- Informal discussions with pro VC (start 2017) - FAIL
- Going public with **#BulliedIntoBadScience** (June 2017)

## Success?

- Numbers?
- Feedback - Yes
- In Cambridge - FAIL. (**But that doesn't matter, as long as others
  benefits. It never was meant to be a Cambridge thing anyway.**)
- ... declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) in Cambridge: "No way
  on Godâ€™s earth"

## Continuing the fight

- So much work, so little time.
- Evidence to the UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee
  inquiry on [Research
  Integrity](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/research-integrity-17-19/).
- Update our webpage, tranlsations, regular blog posts, ....
- Bring the discussion about DORA to the Regent House?


## ECR struggle

- And my day job? Why do *ECR* need to fight for a **better**, open and
  more **trustworthy** research?
- What will be the impact on being an open activist on my career? **Good, IMHO**

<hr />

- There are too many fights to pick - **pick your battles**
- There are multiple ways to fight any battle, and often several are needed in parallel.
- Official path and community efforts.
